# Simple NLP for Lantern v2 Prototyping

### Purpose

To develop fast & easy models to simulate different aspects of nsv-lantern v2.
- Set simple baselines early
- Develop experience and intuition implementing NLP
- Explore implementing existing NLP tools for this application
- Learn more about what we 'don't know'

### Overview

Ultimately, we want a user to type in the words or phrases describing a child/adolescent's
behavior, and get feedback on the type of violence risks related to those behaviors.

One of the highlights of the Lantern will be a lexicon that contains relationships between
violence words found in literature (and evetually other sources). That is going to be a 
large undertaking, and we do not want to wait for that before working on other aspects of
the project.

We also have an upcoming workshop with a corporate backer that will dramatically accelerate 
this project. The work that occurs here may be depricated by that, however, we are confident
building simple models here will improve our understanding for future development and the 
effectiveness of the collaboration.
